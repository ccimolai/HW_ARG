# HW_ARG
In this repository, scripts and some of the intermediate results used for conducting the work "Assessing Argentina's Heatwave Dynamics (1950-2022): A Comprehensive Analysis of Temporal and Spatial variability using ERA5-LAND" are provided. 

Seven R language scripts (enumerated) are presented, which were utilized in the development of the current research project.

In the "HwArg_t" folder, you will find the raster files "tx_ARG_era5land.tiff" and "tn_ARG_era5land.tiff." 
These files contain georeferenced ERA5-LAND data with daily temporal resolution for the period 1950-2022 (for both maximum and minimum temperatures, tx and tn).

In the "HwR_events" folder, you will find the results of applying the HeatwaveR package to the temperature data extracted from ERA5 LAND for tx and tn.
